# TODO: Write routines for fitting transiting planet data using GPs and other methods. 

# Routine 1. Straightforward transit/eclipse fit.
# Routine 2. Phase curve fit. Essentially consisting of a phase curve dataset at low
# time resolution and a transit/eclipse dataset at higher time resolution. The phase
# curve will be modelled as a simple low-order sinusoidal variation. Systematics parameters
# can be shared between the two datasets.
